Refuge Technology is a group of developers, engineers, and open-source enthusiasts making software to help our fellow humans in need.

We are currently building Take Refuge - an application to allow anyone to offer their homes to displaced individuals affected by conflicts, natural disasters, and mass-displacement events all over the world.
